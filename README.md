## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

I didn't know about the background-position and background-repeat tags. Working with those was very useful to learn to customize background images.

```css
body {
  background-image: url("./images/bg-pattern-top.svg"), url("./images/bg-pattern-bottom.svg");
  background-position: right 50vw bottom 20vh, left 45vw top 37vh;
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
}
```

### Useful resources

- [CSS-Tricks: background-position](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/b/background-position/) - This helped me to understand better the background-position property.
